Hi, I'm Jen!

I discovered my passion for software development while retraining at Developers Institute here in Aoteoroa New Zealand. 

#### What I'm working on now

- A [personal site](https://github.com/ajenstory) that will be a digital garden of sorts. I also plan to share projects I am working on, and share some writing 👩🏻‍💻

#### What I'm working on next

- Resuming work on an online course registation and management platform for continuing professional development, complete with an easy-to-use online administration system, learner enrolment and certification. With secure payment processing through Stripe. 🎓

#### Other projects in progress

- A recipe finder and menu builder that helps foodies and restaurateurs build sustainable menu plans with a low carbon footprint in mind 🍏

- A messaging and service booking system that connects dog owners with trusted dog walkers, feeders, companions, and daycare providers in their local area 🐶
