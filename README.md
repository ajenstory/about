Hi, I'm Jen!

I'm a developer and digital strategist based near a beautiful stretch of coastline in Ruakākā, Te tai tokerau / Northland &nbsp;[about 2 hours drive north of Tāmaki Makaurau / Auckland in Aotearoa, New Zealand](https://goo.gl/maps/SBy16KxPjGRVYPbu5).

#### What I'm working on now &nbsp;👩🏻‍💻
I'm currently working through coding challenges and tutorials to learn and improve on my current skill set. Developing concepts and exploring new areas of interest. At the moment, these are:
- [JenCorbett.dev: Personal portfolio and site](https://github.com/ajenstory/jencorbett.dev) 
- [Habitude: Gratitude Tracker](https://github.com/ajenstory/habitude)
- [WishWizard: Personalised wishlist manager](https://github.com/ajenstory/wishwizard) 

#### What I'm working on next  &nbsp;🎓
- AILA - an online course registation and management app for continuing professional development, complete with an easy-to-use online administration system, learner enrolment and certification. With secure payment processing through Stripe.   
- A menu building app that helps foodies and restaurateurs build sustainable menu plans with a low carbon footprint in mind 
- A service finder app connecting dog owners with trusted dog walkers, feeders, companions, and daycare providers in their local area 

#### More about me  &nbsp;👩🏻‍🚀
I recently graduated from Developers Institute, following a lifeling passion for technology. Before that I worked in social media and digital marketing. I'm a proud cat and dog lady, a creative, sometime thespian, and a virtual flâneuse.
